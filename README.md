Aspiring AI Software Engineer currently building foundational skills in Python and Cloud (AWS). 
I am focused on learning by doing: small projects, consistent GitHub activity, and developing real-world problem-solving ability. 

Right now, I am:
- Learning Python fundamentals & automation
- Studying AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials
- Exploring open-source & MLH Fellowship opportunities

My goal is to grow into someone who can build practical tools, collaborate on projects,
and contribute to software that solves real user problems. I am not claiming expertise—
I am building it step-by-step, in public.

Current Skills (Learning Stage)
- Python (basics, CLI apps, file handling, JSON(basics))
- AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials (just started)
- Git & GitHub (commits, pushing projects)
